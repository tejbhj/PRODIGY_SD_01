This tool is a simple GUI-based application that allows users to convert temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The user inputs a temperature value, selects the unit of the input temperature, and the tool provides the converted values in the other two units.

Requirements

* Python 3.11.4
* tkinter library (usually included with Python)

How to Use the Tool

* Run the Python script: You can run the script in any Python environment or IDE of your choice (e.g., PyCharm, VS Code, IDLE, etc.).
* Enter the temperature: Input the temperature you want to convert in the provided text box.
* Select the unit: Choose the unit of the temperature you entered (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin) from the drop-down menu.
* Convert: Click on the "Convert" button to see the temperature converted to the other two units.
* View Results: The converted temperature values will be displayed on the screen.

Example Use Case:

If you input 100 and select Celsius from the drop-down menu, the tool will display:
* Temperature in Fahrenheit: 212.00
* Temperature in Kelvin: 373.15

Have fun experimenting with temperature conversions and learning how temperatures relate in different units!
